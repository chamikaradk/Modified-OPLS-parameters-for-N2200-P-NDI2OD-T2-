# Modified-OPLS-parameters-for-N2200
OPLS parameters for N2200 polymer provided. Charges and dihedrals potentials are explicitly calculated using DFT OT-w-HPBE 6-31G** level, and using charge model 5 (CM5). We have carried out the explicite parameterization to elucidate crystal polymorphic models of N2200 or P(NDI2OD-T2) using classical molecular dynamics.
